# AVP_USDZ

## Project Overview
AVP_USDZ is an innovative application designed to leverage Apple's RealityKit and ARKit to place USDZ objects in real-world spaces. This application targets the Apple Vision Pro, providing users with an immersive augmented reality experience. With AVP_USDZ, users can visualize 3D models seamlessly integrated into their environment, enhancing the way we interact with digital content.

## Features
- **Seamless Object Placement**: Easily place and manipulate USDZ objects in real-world environments.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: A user-friendly interface that makes it simple to navigate and interact with AR content.
- **Support for Multiple Objects**: Load and display multiple USDZ files simultaneously.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Enjoy smooth and realistic rendering of 3D objects in augmented reality.
- **User Customization**: Options for customizing the appearance and behavior of 3D objects.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Optimized for use with Apple Vision Pro, but compatible with other iOS devices supporting ARKit.
